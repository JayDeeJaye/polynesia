    "Q-Learning is a machine learning technique which is useful in a risk and reward environment, such as a game. It's attractive for stochastic situations, in which the perception of the environment is not complete, because it doesn't have to calculate the probabilities of all possibilities in any given state. It can continuously collect and store information and deduce an optimal policy from the outcomes of what's already happened. The more it plays, the more it learns, and the better it gets at choosing the right thing."
