    "# Basic Strategy in Blackjack\n",
    "Experts in Blackjack do in fact recommend a strategy for playing. While it does not guarantee success, it does increase the chances of prolonging the game, which provides more opportunity for favorable outcomes. The strategy is based purely on memoryless processes and probabilities within the confines of the rules of the game. Another strategy, known as card counting, keeps a record of the cards which have already been played. If this information is used to calculate the probabilities of outcome the changes of success become greater. This gives the player an unfair advantage over the dealer and is considered illegal. We may explore just how much of an advantage memory of cards played gives if we have time, but for now, we just want to model the basic strategy as a measure of how well our algorithm is learning the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's review our game space:\n",
    "* The objective is to end with a higher point value than the dealer without going over 21.\n",
    "* There are two actions a Player and Dealer can take: HIT, and STAND.\n",
    "* The Player has freedom of choice to hit or stand at will.\n",
    "* The Dealer must follow rules:\n",
    "  * On 16 or under, the Dealer must hit\n",
    "  * On 17 or over, the Dealer must stand\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these constraints, the player can make optimal choices. The table below is an example of the choices most likely to end up favorably for the Player in which the game is played with a single deck of cards shuffled as needed."
